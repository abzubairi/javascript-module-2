/*

Think of 5 different real world "things" that you 
can describe with a JavaScript object

Assign each of them to a separate variable


For example:
var car = {
    brand: "Seat",
    model: "Arona",
    color: "white",
    horsepower: 115,
    doors: 5
};

*/
var mobile = {
  brand: "redmi",
  model: "note 9 pro",
  ram: "8GB",
  Memory: "128GB",
  color: "blue",
  price: 45000,
};
